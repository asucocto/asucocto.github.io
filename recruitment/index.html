              <p>On this day, you will receive the final decision that will tell you if you are accepted to the organization. If you are not accepted to the organization, it is no big deal - there have been plenty of engineers in OCTO who were not accepted into the organization the first time they applied but were able to get in the next semester. We highly encourage you to apply again!</p>
