                <p id="about-p">Every bear has been a situation where an emergency prevents him or her from going to class. Using state-of-the-art Computer Vision technology, our software developers were able to automate the lecture recording process so that it is easier for the administration to pay for lecture casting and easier for professors to set up the process. Our hope is that we will be able help students who are in DSP or otherwise disadvantaged to view lectures that are not currently recorded by ETS. We plan on doing this by a request-based system. Check our our alpha demo <a href="https://hermione.io/">here.</a> Feel free to ping us as technology@asuc.org if you would like to give us a try!</p>
