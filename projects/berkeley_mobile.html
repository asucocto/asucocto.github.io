                <p id="about-p">The Berkeley Mobile Application has a plethora features, including real-time BearTransit Routes, Dining hall menus (including breakfast, lunch, dinner, and late night menus for all dining halls), schedules for all of our public athletic facilities, and hours for every library on campus. We are also adding new features such as AC Transit integration and gym classes. We believe that the application is an absolute necessity for the busy Berkeley Student. Download the app for free for iOS <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/berkeley-mobile/id912243518?mt=8">here</a> and for Android <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.asuc.asucmobile&hl=en">here</a>.</p>
