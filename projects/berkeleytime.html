               <p id="about-p">BerkeleyTime is a website that allows you to search the 8000+ courses from the Berkeley catalog and figure out what you're interested in. You can look up grade distributions and enrollment history for these classes and even explore the campus map to figure out where everything is. We have updated the course catalog to make sure that it is up to date and are also in the process of a scheduler to allow you to see what classes you are interested in taking. We believe that BerkeleyTime will change the way you do things at Berkeley. Visit the site by going <a href="http://www.berkeleymobile.com">here.</a></p>
