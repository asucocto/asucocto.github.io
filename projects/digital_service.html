                <p id="about-p">The ASUC Digital Service is dedicated to providing the ASUC and the general student population with software consulting services. We take ideas and feedback from the campus community regarding what gaps there are in software on campus and create full-stack web applications to fill in those gaps. This semester, we have some exciting projects, including projects in conjunction with the AAVP's Office and with the Student Advocates' Office. We're open to new ideas for projects to better the school and the ASUC! Interested?
