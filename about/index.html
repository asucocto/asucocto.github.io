    <div class="container">
        <p id="about-p">The Office of the CTO was created in the Spring of 2015 in order to provide the general Berkeley community with access to more on-campus technology resources. Since our inception, we have been able to provide our fellow Bears with quality software products. Starting with just a handful of developers and a single Mobile Application that was available only on iOS, we have grown to a full-fledged division of the ASUC with over 30 talented members. Our Office currently has three products: Berkeley Mobile, BerkeleyTime, and Project Hermione. Our staff handles everything from Android, iOS, and Backend development to Marketing and Product Management. You can see the products that we currently have in production <a href="/projects">here</a>. Interested in seeing our schedule?
